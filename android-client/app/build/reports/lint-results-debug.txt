   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/workspaces/ERDMT/android-client/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml:2: Warning: The resource R.layout.activity_main appears to be unused [UnusedResources]
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
^

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.

/workspaces/ERDMT/android-client/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:6: Warning: Should explicitly set android:icon, there is no default [MissingApplicationIcon]
    <application
     ~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "MissingApplicationIcon":
   You should set an icon for the application as whole because there is no
   default. This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource
   containing the image (for example @drawable/icon).
